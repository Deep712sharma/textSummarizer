This text summarizer is a deep learning model. 
This model can create a summary for the provided text.
This model can summarize text from the following----
1. Word Document
2. Text PDFs
3. Images

The libraries/modules used in this model are----
1. OS -> The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. 
2. docx -> python-docx is a Python library for creating and updating Microsoft Word (. docx) files.
3. spacy -> The spaCy Python library is a popular tool for natural language processing (NLP). It is designed to help developers build applications that process and "understand" large volumes of text.
4. string -> The string module is a built-in Python module that provides various string-related constants, functions, and classes. It includes a set of string constants, such as ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation marks, as well as the Template class for string substitution using templates.
5. heapq -> Heap queue is a special tree structure in which each parent node is less than or equal to its child node. In python it is implemented using the heapq module. It is very useful is implementing priority queues where the queue item with higher weight is given more priority in processing.
6. fitz -> Fitz was originally intended as an R&D project to replace the aging Ghostscript graphics library, but has instead become the rendering engine powering MuPDF.
7. pytesseract -> Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python.It can read all types of images supported by the Pillow, including jpeg, png, gif.It will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.
8. PIL -> PIL stands for Python Imaging Library, and it's the original library that enabled Python to deal with images.
9. PyPDF2 -> PyPDF2 is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. It can also add custom data, viewing options, and passwords to PDF files.
10. IO -> Python io module allows us to manage the file-related input and output operations. The advantage of using the IO module is that the classes and functions available allows us to extend the functionality to enable writing to the Unicode data.
11. pdf2image -> pdf2image is a light wrapper for the poppler-utils tools that can convert your PDFs into Pillow images.
